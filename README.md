# Prueba3it
Job application test for 3IT with Angular 11, Bootstrap 4, Sass and Chartjs.

## Get started

### Clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/joelfloressottile/prueba3it.git
cd prueba3it
```

### Install npm packages

Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

The `npm start` command builds (compiles TypeScript and copies assets) the application into `dist/`, watches for changes to the source files, and runs `lite-server` on port `3000`.

You can shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.
```
